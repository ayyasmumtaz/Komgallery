# KomGallery

KomGallery is a social media application designed specifically for the Computer Science students at IPB University. It serves as a platform for seamless sharing of photos among the student community, facilitating collaboration and fostering a sense of community engagement. Users can upload, comment on, save, and download photos, as well as associate relevant links with each photo, enabling additional benefits such as event promotions and related resources.

## Technology Stack

The frontend of KomGallery is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as the core programming languages. To build a robust and interactive user interface, we have chosen the React.js framework. Leveraging the power of React.js, we employ key concepts such as components, props, state management, and component lifecycle methods to efficiently organize and manage the application's view logic. Additionally, we leverage the Tailwind CSS framework, which follows a utility-first approach, enabling us to easily configure layout structures and apply pre-defined CSS styles to enhance the visual aesthetics and responsiveness of the application.

On the backend, we adopt a headless CMS approach using Sanity. Sanity acts as the content provider and serves as the central repository for storing various application content, including the user-uploaded photos. Leveraging the JavaScript API provided by Sanity, we seamlessly interact with the content management system to perform essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, ensuring efficient content management and retrieval processes.

## User Authentication

To ensure secure access and user management, we integrate Google Authentication (OAuth) as a third-party service. By leveraging OAuth, users can securely log in to KomGallery using their Google accounts, eliminating the need for manual user authentication management. This integration relies on the robust security infrastructure provided by Google, ensuring user authentication is streamlined, reliable, and highly secure.

## Deployment

KomGallery is deployed using Netlify, a powerful platform for continuous deployment and hosting. The deployment process is streamlined, enabling automatic deployments whenever changes are pushed to the repository. The live version of KomGallery can be accessed at [https://komgallery.netlify.app](https://komgallery.netlify.app), where users can explore its features and functionalities.
